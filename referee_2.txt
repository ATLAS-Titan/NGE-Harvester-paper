Section 1: 
Give a reference to PanDA

Put the reference to Harvester here where it is first mentioned
Same for RADICAL-Pilot, put the reference here 
"directly scheduling tasks" -> "directly schedule tasks"

Section 2:

Section 3:

Executing tasks from different users or organisations in the same pilot sounds like a huge security hole, one job can tamper with data from another experiment or access credentials from another job. Can you address this concern in the text?
