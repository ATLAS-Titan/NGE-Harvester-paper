Referee 1:

This contribution is unclear in several areas, largely due to lack of introduction of new concepts. Recommend significant changes, particularly the following:

- Please add a corresponding author, according to the template at https://www.webofconferences.org/authors. Also correct the formatting of the references
- Please expand acronyms the first time they are used in the body of the paper, e.g. HPC 
- Please extend the abstract to summarise what the paper will present. It is not clear what the objective of the paper is.  
- Many concepts are used without introduction or reference. Please clarify throughout the submission and include references with concepts or acronyms wherever possible, e.g. PanDA, NGE, Harvester, RADICAL-pilot, RADICAL-SAGA. 
- Figure 1, please replace with a higher definition image
- For clarity, please split the Conclusion into a Conclusion and Next Steps
